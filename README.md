# Template Module
The Template Module is a module for Dom's Nexus that adds various functionality and serves as a reference for how to make proper modules. It implements various random mechanics for the purposes of showcasing how to use the Nexus. The current version implements four entities and one object. The four entities are a skull mob, a physics-based soccer ball, a car, and the spider brain. The one object is a basic sphere generator. The attached resource pack contains the relevant assets used by the module.

# Using the features
Each of the mobs and objects can be spawned by running a certain function in chat.

Spider Brain: `/function temp:entity/spider_brain/spawn/main`

Soccer Ball: `/function temp:entity/ball/spawn/main`

Racecar: `/function temp:entity/racecar/spawn/main`

Skull: `/function temp:entity/skull/spawn/main`

Glass Dome: `/function temp:object/glass_dome/spawn/main`

The Spider Brain and the Skull mobs can be killed like ordinary mobs. The Soccer Ball and the Racecar despawn when they touch fire or lava. The Glass Dome is a physical structure which spawns which can be broken normally.

# Terms of Use
These are the terms of use for using Dom's Nexus and the official modules for development. Any restrictions posed by these terms supersede freedoms granted by the attached license.
1) You are allowed to modify the Nexus if it is used in a map or on a server in any way you wish, but you are not allowed to publicly redistribute the modified version of the Nexus outside of a map. You are allowed to include the Nexus in a map and distribute the map whether the Nexus is modified or unmodified. But do not distribute the Nexus outside of a map. Instead, link to this repository.
2) The terms applied to the Nexus also apply to the External Time Measurer, the Database Library, and the Function Tree Library.
3) Do not distribute Nexus modules outside of a map that rely on a modified version of the Nexus. Any module which is publicly distributed expects the Nexus to contain certain features and releasing a module which relies on a modified version of the Nexus would create compatibility issues. Every module which you release as a standalone module outside of a map must depend on an official unmodified version of the Nexus.
4) You may modify and redistribute the Template Module in any way you wish.
